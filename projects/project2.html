        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A class project, was to setup a ordering system for the users and restaurants where restaurants can manage on the page. Working with a group of 4. We were able to complete
          this interesting project using the MERN stack.

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>Some challenges we faced was finding the right tools for starting this project. We wanted something that we all were able to do and we chose the MERN stack.
          Learning about API safety and testing API's using Postman was challenging at first cause of 403 unauthorized messages, it was a headache at first but learning about tokens and caches
          was really nice.
        </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>Working with a team was amazing, I learned a lot with amazing people. I learned more about API's, databases, and how to manage AWS instances. </p>
